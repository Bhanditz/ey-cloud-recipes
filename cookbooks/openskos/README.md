========================

This recipe configures an OpenSKOS installation based on configuration files
auto-generated by Engine Yard, and any additional settings you specify.

Dependencies
============

The OpenSKOS configuration file is expected to be located at
/data/APP_NAME/current/application/configs/application.ini

If it does not exist, but application.ini.dist does in that directory, this will
be used as the template and application.ini created.

Usage
=====

The recipe will run on all application, utility and solo instances.

Automatic configuration performed:
* Database address, adapter & authentication details

To apply any additional configuration settings, edit the :openskos_config
hash in attributes/default.rb.

Limitations
===========

This recipe will update the section of the OpenSKOS configuration file with the
key matching the framework environment name, e.g. "production", "development".

It will not update any sections of the configuration file keyed to imply
inheritence from another section, e.g. "development : production".

You will need therefore to ensure that your environment has a section of its
own in order for this recipe to be effective.
